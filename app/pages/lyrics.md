# Lyrics

just whatever came to mind

```
I start watching television
Sans parental supervision
Universe of empty wishes
Before I have to do the dishes
```

```
THE OUTSIDE IS SILENT
THE INSIDE IS VIOLENT
```

```
Well there's nothin' on the line
'cept a couple billion lives
So what you gettin' worked up for
```

```
I got machine gun kelly
and my shotgun nelly
```

```
Nows your chance to be a big shot - dryer edit
(This one  isn't a song, but imagine big shot with dryer sounds)
```

```
Theres no way to justify 
the ill-defined will-defying

.. benign crime slime bribe
```

```
How you gonna hate me when you dont even know me
How you gonna slay me when you move in slow motion
```
